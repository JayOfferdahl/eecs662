Hey Dr. Perry,

Here's my submission for assignment 1. I had quite the time trying to
figure out how to adapt your quickcheck tests to test this program
right. My problem boiled down my interp function as it typechecked
the input and then optimized it before finally evaluating. When this
was compared to the simple evaluation, different type mismatches 
would sometimes be returned which would fail the case. 

-- After our discussion, it is quite interesting to see the
difference between static and dynamic type checking in action!

In the end, this was a great project to work on!

Thanks,

Jay
