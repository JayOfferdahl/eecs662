Hey Dr. Perry,

Here's my submission for assignment 4. I once again used the let
notation for mostly everything with a few case statements thrown in.

Also, it may look weird, but when setting up my "interpTyped"
interpreter, but I explicitly pattern match on all three of the
allowed types in our language. The reason I do this is because if I
just use a catch all, an incorrect type (i.e., an error) still gets
evaluated, which is obviously wrong behavior.

Lastly, I just want to say thanks for everything. I had a blast in
your class. It definitely helps the learning process when the 
instructor is the most passionate and excited person in the room.

Until next time,

Jay
